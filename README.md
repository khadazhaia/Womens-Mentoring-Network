# Women’s Mentoring Network 

## Project Overview

This project aims to solve a database and documentation consolidation issue occurring within a local nonprofit through merging existing physical and digital documents using a composite ID that contains:

- an auto-generated client ID
- First & Last Name with Middle Initial
- Birthdate
- City and State
- Phone Number

The composite ID will unite scattered information across different locations into one centralized Client Database, allowing staff to view client progress, client metrics, and the organization’s KPIs and details easily.

## Project Breakdown

## Phase 1

Creation of ETL code to be tested against dummy data containing common mistakes present during data entry. Code will be used to address common issues such as duplicates before merging data under a unique client ID.

## Phase 2

AI integration of existing products to streamline consolidation. The organization uses Microsoft 365 and DropBox separately. DropBox has a free integration with Microsoft 365 as well as AI tools to assist with organization.

## Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Microsoft Excel
